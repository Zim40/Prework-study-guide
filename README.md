# Coding Bootcamp Prework Study Guide
## Why a Study Guide?

 - This project has been made to effectively keep learning and also give ideas on what to study next at any given   time   with the randomized topic selector in the Console.log.
 - Building and using this project will help me to go back over what I have learned in previous lessons and target certain areas of study, making it easier to focus on one topic as opposed to being information overloaded.


 
 ### What did I learn?
<ul>
<li>Basic HTML</li>
<li>Basic CSS</li>

<li>Basic JavaScript</li>
